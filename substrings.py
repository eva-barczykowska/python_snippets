"""
Write a function that takes a string of integers as input and returns the number of substrings that result in an odd number when converted to an integer.

Examples:
solve("1341") # should return 7
solve("1357") # should return 10

Problem:
-take a string and create substrings gradually
-see what substrings, when converted to int, are odd numbers
-create them and count how many you have
-return that number

Examples
solve("1341") # should return 7

1341
----
1
13
134
1341
-3
-34
-341
--4
--41
---1

-> 10 substrings in total
-> 7 odd numbers: 1, 13, 1341, 3, 341, 41, 1
solve("1357") # should return 10

A:
-iterate over the string and gradually cut substrings
-outer loop and inner loop
-add the generated substrings to a list
-covert the strings in the list to nums
-count odd nums
-return the count

#AI feedback
# 1.	Too many variables: outer_counter, inner_counter, substrings â€” a bit more verbose than needed.
# 2.	Appending all substrings first and then filtering â†’ uses extra memory.
# 3.	Using while loops where for loops would be more readable.
