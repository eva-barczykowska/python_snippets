# The __init__.py file in Python is used to mark directories as Python packages.
# It serves two main purposes:

# Package initialization: When Python imports a package, it executes the code in the __init__.py file.
# This can be used to:
# perform setup tasks,
# define package-level variables,
# or import other modules.

# Module discovery: When a directory contains an __init__.py file, Python treats it as a package.
# This allows other modules to import modules from that directory using a dot notation,
# like import slsrestclient.module_name.

# async
# The async keyword in Python is used to define a coroutine function.
# A coroutine is a special kind of function that can be paused and resumed,
# allowing other code to run in between. This is particularly useful when dealing with I/O-bound tasks,
# such as making HTTP requests or reading/writing to a database.
#
# When you use the async keyword, you('re essentially telling Python that this function will contain
# one or more await expressions.
# An await expression is used to pause the execution of the coroutine until the awaited task is complete. This allows other code to run while waiting for the task to finish.)
