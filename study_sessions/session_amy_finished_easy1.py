# Leap Years (Part 1)
# Write a function that takes any year greater than 0 as input and returns True if the year is a leap year, or False if it is not.

# For simplicity, this exercise assumes that the Gregorian calendar has been in continuous use since the year 1. We'll address that assumption in the next exercise that follows this one.

# To determine whether a given year is a leap year, use the rules of the Gregorian calendar:

# If the year is divisible by 400, it is a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 100 but not by 400, it is not a leap year.
# If the year is divisible by 4 but not by 100, it is a leap year.
# All other years are not leap years.

# These examples should all print True

# '''
# Goal: intake a year and return a boolean dependent on whether or not it's a leap year.
# INput: integer
# output: boolean

# Rules:
# - year is divisible by 400 -> return True
# - year is divisible by 100 but not 400 -> False
# - year is divisible by 4 but not by 100 -> True

# E:
# print(is_leap_year(4) == True)
#  - 4%4 == 0

# In the previous exercise, we assumed that the Gregorian calendar has been in continuous use since the year 1. However, the Gregorian calendar wasn't adopted until much later; prior to that, much of the world used the Julian calendar, which observed leap year every 4 years.

# in 1752, England, Ireland, and the British colonies all switched to the Gregorian calendar. Update the function from the previous exercise so it uses the Julian calendar prior to 1752, and the Gregorian calendar starting in 1752.
