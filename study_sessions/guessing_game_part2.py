# Number Guesser Part 2
# In the previous exercise, you wrote a number guessing game that determines a secret number between 1 and 100, and gives the user 7 opportunities to guess the number.

# Update your solution to accept a low and high value when you create a GuessingGame object, and use those values to compute a secret number for the game. You should also change the number of guesses allowed so the user can always win if she uses a good strategy. You can compute the number of guesses with:

import math

# "high" is the highest number in the range
# "low" is the lowest number in the range

# Create an object-oriented number guessing class for numbers in the range 1 to 100,
# with a limit of 7 guesses per game. The game should play like this:
import random


class GuessingGame:
    def __init__(self, low, high):
        self.target = random.choice(list(range(low, high)))
        self.low = low
        self.high = high
        self.guesses = int(math.log2(high - low + 1)) + 1

    def play(self):
        while True:
            if self.guesses == 0:
                print("You have no more guesses. You lost!")
                break
            print(f"You have {self.guesses} guesses remaining.")
            user_answer = input(f"Enter a number between {self.low} and {self.high}:")

            try:
                user_answer = int(user_answer)
            except ValueError:
                print(f"It must be a number. Enter a number between {self.low} and {self.high}: ")
                continue # skip the rest of the current iteration

            if user_answer not in range(self.low, self.high):
                user_answer = int(input(f"Invalid guess. Enter a number between {self.low} and {self.high}: "))

            if user_answer != self.target:
                if user_answer < self.target:
                    print("Your guess is too low.")
                    self.guesses -= 1
                elif user_answer > self.target:
                    print("Your guess is too high.")
                    self.guesses -= 1
            else:
                print("That's the number!")
                print("You won!")
                break
